# Basics

## What is a Programming Language

1. A programming language is essentially an abstraction on another low level language or code which can interact with the computing resources in some fashion.
2. Essentially computer only understand 1 & 0's which is just an electrical signal, and humans are not very good with numbers or it would be very tedious and inefficient for a human to type in 0/1 to make the computer do something.
3. Hence we write a program in natural language like english. But the machine/computer only understands an electrical signal and hence to convert the human friendly natural language to machine code we have programs called complier or interpreter.
4. The Job of compiler or interpreter is to take in the code file which is close to natural language and convert the same to machine code or IL. Again we have lot of abstractions on operating system level as in OS kernel provided routines and such which helps in getting the task done.

## What is Python

1. Python is a interpreted language which reads the code line by line, interprets it and does the compute/resource level action.
2. It is user/programmer/beginner friendly and with a large community of developer and the fact that its open source which paved the path to it being a very popular programming language with a wide variety of use cases for which it can be used like Backend, Frontend, Machine Learning, DS etc.
3. The fact that its interpreted means that its slower than complied language (which converts the code to Machine Code like .exe/.sh/.dll etc), the reason being complied language has the machine level code already ready to go while an interpreted language need to the do the conversion on the fly. Hence enterprise application which needs to closely work system interface prefer a complied language like Java/C#/Rust/C/C++ etc.
