# Developer Fundamentals 1

Do not try to learn every single trick in the book, you cannot remember the same anyway. You need to understand that a feature is present in the language and you can skim through the documentation or a reference to look at the syntax. From my experience we need to understand and keep in mind that there is a tool in the language to handle a certain problem and with practice it will become part of your muscle memory. Focus of the features you would most use and good to know about features or libraries/modules in a language like Disk IO, HTTP/S Client etc.
