# Variables

1. Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
2. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.
3. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.
4. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.
5. Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type.
6. Every variable in Python is an object.
7. Explicitly strongly typing variables is done by adding a colon and the type after the variable name.

   ```python
        price: float = 10.5
        quantity: int = 4
        total: float = price * quantity
        print(total) # 42.0
        print(type(total)) # <class 'float'>
   ```

8. You can let Python decide the type of the variable by not adding a type after the variable name.

   ```python
        item_price = 10.5
        item_quantity = 4
        item_total = item_price * item_quantity
        print(item_total) # 42.0
        print(type(item_total)) # <class 'float'>
   ```

9. Variables should be named in snake_case.
10. Variables are case sensitive.
11. Cannot use keywords as variable names.
12. Start a variable by a letter or underscore.
13. Private variable should start with _ by convention, not syntax like _my_private_var.
14. Constants should be all caps by convention, not syntax like PI.
15. Dunder variable starts with __ like __main__.
